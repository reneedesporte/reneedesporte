I'm an engineer at SRI International in the Bay Area, California.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics from Louisiana State University in 2020, where I researched quantum networks and assisted in writing [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00327-5).

I've been at SRI International since July 2021, and I've worked on projects for applications such as drone detection, robotic automation, and space debris detection.

I'm interested in continuing my software development journey, so I'm currently working on my own small projects as exercises. I'm open to collaborating on or contributing to open source projects.
