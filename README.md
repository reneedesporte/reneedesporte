Hey! I'm Renee and I'm an engineer in the Bay Area. I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics from Louisiana State University in 2020, where I researched quantum networks and assisted in writing [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00327-5). I've been at SRI International since July 2021, and I've worked on projects for applications such as drone detection, robotic automation, space debris detection, and simulation tool modernization.

I work on my own small projects here and there, such as adding [documentation](https://github.com/reneedesporte/grcwa/tree/documentation) to [`grcwa`](https://github.com/weiliangjinca/grcwa). Check out [my website](https://reneedesporte.github.io/) and my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renee-desporte/).
